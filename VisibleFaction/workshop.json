{"workshopId":2434428040,"Title":"Visible Factions - Fyrefly's QoL","Description":"Why dost thou hate me so?\n\nTo what reputation do I owe such adoration?\n\nIf I am to pilfer thine contents, which social club shalt declare a blood-oath to destroy me?\n\nAnswer these questions, and more, though, honestly, mostly just these, with Visible Factions, part of Fyrefly's QoL collection.\n\nBy simply Looking at an object, this advanced modification will provide you with unique insight into your targets (faction) or [owner], as well as that factions disposition towards you - which is not always equivalent to an NPC's personal opinion of you!\n\nHidden factions remain hidden, so not all objects are declared thus - some mysteries must always remain within the denizenry of Qud!\n\n----------------------\n\nWorks for both the Console and Overlay UI\n\nInspired, with permission, by HunterZ's \"Show Owner & Faction\", which only works on the Overlay UI.\n\nShould be highly compatible with most other mods and future updates, even if they modify \"Look\" functionality. You can even have it alongside HunterZ's mod, if you're keen on getting a second opinion every time you're uncertain about a creature's faction! Though, as HunterZ's mod uses a factions Name, whereas this uses their Display Name, you do technically get different information from each, now thats what I call comprehensive!","Tags":"UI, Script","Visibility":"2","ImagePath":"preview.png"}
